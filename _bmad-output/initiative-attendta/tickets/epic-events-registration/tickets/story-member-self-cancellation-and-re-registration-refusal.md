# Member self-cancellation and re-registration refusal

## Description

Enables a member to cancel their own pending, confirmed or waitlisted registration on a Published Event before the cutoff and before Valid Attendance, after an explicit confirmation warning that cancellation is final, under the owner's `users` row and then the event lock; `IRegistrationCancellationService.CancelRegistrationAsync` (`MemberRequested`) clears the QR token, releases the seat without promotion and records metadata, and re-registration is refused by the unique key.

## Requirements

Verify: A confirmed member cancels their registration after confirming the warning dialog, observing their seat released and QR token cleared with an Activity Log entry, and a subsequent registration attempt is refused.

# Shared centered record dialog and Event Type editor tracer

## Description

Deliver the reusable centered-record-dialog interaction and convert Event Type create/edit as the tracer for #128, using the real existing services. Preserve required markers and grouping shipped in #132. Cover fetch or row hydration, retained input and field errors inside the dialog, submitting feedback, focus containment/restoration, Escape/Cancel and separate status actions. Publish the reusable partial/JavaScript contract for 2.13/2.14; do not rewrite the backend.

## Requirements

Verify: An Officer creates and edits an Event Type from the list in a centered dialog, corrects a duplicate-name error without losing entered values, and can open/save/cancel with keyboard focus returned to the trigger. The dialog fits a 390px viewport.

## Notes

- Demo phase (2026-11-06 demo rescope): frontend only, real backend only; this ticket adds no demo data.
- Done check: `dotnet build`, `npm run css:build` when views or styles change, and one look at the changed screen with `DemoData__Enabled=true`. No new automated tests, no per-ticket Impeccable critique or polish and no separate code-review pass; the pull request keeps green existing CI and one peer approval. Critique, polish and the full Verify line run once in 8.15.

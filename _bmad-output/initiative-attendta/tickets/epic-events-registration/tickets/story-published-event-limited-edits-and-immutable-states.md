# Published event limited edits and immutable states

## Description

Restricts updates on Published Events to title, description and Cover replacement through `IEventLifecycleService` under the event type → venue → event lock order, logging old and new title and description values and recording a cover replacement with no file path in `event.updated`, while locking Completed and Cancelled Events as read-only.

## Requirements

Verify: An officer updates the title and description of a Published Event and sees the change with old and new values in the Activity Log, a cover replacement appears there without any file path, and server validation rejects changes to schedule, venue, limit or deadline.

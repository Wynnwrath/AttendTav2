# Refactor sweep

## Description

Cleans up deferred review findings, legacy Bootstrap markup artifacts, and dead code across Master Data controllers, services, and views without adding new scope.

## Requirements

Verify: The solution builds with zero warnings, all Master Data tests pass, and no InvalidDataException, GetActorUserId, actorUserId parameter, DateTime.UtcNow or Roles-string authorization remains in Master Data code or views.

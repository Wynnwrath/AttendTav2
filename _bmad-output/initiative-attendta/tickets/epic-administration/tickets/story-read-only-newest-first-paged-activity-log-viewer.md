# Read-only newest-first paged Activity Log viewer

## Description

Builds the read-only Activity Log screen for the Administrator policy, paged with PageRequest and the shared _Pager at 25 rows (AD-13), ordered occurred_at DESC, log_id DESC. Each row shows occurred time through the shared Asia/Manila formatter (AD-11, epic-platform-access entry 1.4), actor name and type, action, affected entity type and id, and reason. The screen has no edit or delete control.

## Requirements

Verify: Given at least 26 Activity Log rows seeded in the database, an Administrator opens the Activity Log at /admin/auditlogs and sees 25 rows per page, newest first with ties broken by log_id, Asia/Manila timestamps with a zone label, actor, action, affected record and reason, and no edit or delete controls. An Officer requesting the same route is refused.

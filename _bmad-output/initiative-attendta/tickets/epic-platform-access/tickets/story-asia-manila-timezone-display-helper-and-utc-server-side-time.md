# Asia/Manila timezone display helper and UTC server-side time standard

## Description

Injects System.TimeProvider wherever Services or Data read the time, replaces every DateTime.Now and DateTime.UtcNow in ASI.Basecode.Services (UserService, EventTypeService, MemberService and VenueService included, since AD-11 binds all epics) with GetUtcNow() compared against stored UTC datetime2(3), and adds one shared Asia/Manila (+08:00) Razor formatter in WebApp that appends the zone label.

## Requirements

Verify: a Services.Tests test with a fake TimeProvider shows a service reads only the injected clock; a search of ASI.Basecode.Services finds no DateTime.Now or DateTime.UtcNow; a WebApp formatter test renders a UTC value as Asia/Manila with its label.

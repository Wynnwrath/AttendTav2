# Signup deadline enforcement at exact local boundary

## Description

Proves the Signup Deadline at its exact boundary for stale submissions: `ParticipationFacts` Signup open at the instant of the deadline is tested in Services.Tests with a fake `TimeProvider`, and the closure shows the deadline in Asia/Manila; earlier registrations remain intact and the Event stays Published in the feed.

## Requirements

Verify: A member attempting to register one tick before the deadline succeeds, and at or after the deadline receives an explicit closure refusal; earlier registrations remain intact and the Event remains Published in the feed.

# Role assignment with last-active-Administrator app lock

## Description

Enables an Administrator to assign the Member, Officer, or Administrator Role to an Account with a mandatory reason (users.role_id, roles lookup) under the Administrator policy, in one ExecuteInTransactionAsync. When the target is an active Administrator and the new role is not Administrator, it first takes sp_getapplock 'attendta:last-admin' (Exclusive, owner Transaction, bounded @LockTimeout; a negative return throws Stale), then locks the target's users row, then re-reads the target and counts active Administrators; rejecting demotions of the last active Administrator with explanatory feedback. Each change appends one user.role_assigned Activity Log entry with old and new role codes in the same transaction.

## Requirements

Verify: An integration test in ASI.Basecode.IntegrationTests (AD-17), with parallel connections against ATTENDTA_TEST_SQL, has two connections each demote one of two active Administrators; exactly one succeeds, the other is refused with explanatory feedback, and one Administrator stays active. A valid role change updates users.role_id, appends one activity_logs row in the same transaction, and the Administrator sees the new role badge on the Console Accounts list.

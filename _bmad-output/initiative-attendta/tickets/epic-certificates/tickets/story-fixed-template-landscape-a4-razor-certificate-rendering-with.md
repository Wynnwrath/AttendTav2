# Fixed-template landscape A4 Razor certificate rendering with embedded fonts

## Description

Implements the fixed landscape A4 Razor certificate template in WebApp/Rendering with locally embedded Cinzel fonts, institutional branding, bindings for recipient name, Event title, Event start, issue date and the certificate number, dates formatted through the shared Asia/Manila formatter with its zone label (AD-11), and a visible development watermark until entry 3, delivering R5's fixed-template PDF part.

## Requirements

Verify: Rendering a certificate from the Razor template produces a landscape A4 PDF with embedded Cinzel fonts, the snapshot values, the certificate number and dates shown in Asia/Manila with a label, a visible development watermark, and no external network requests.

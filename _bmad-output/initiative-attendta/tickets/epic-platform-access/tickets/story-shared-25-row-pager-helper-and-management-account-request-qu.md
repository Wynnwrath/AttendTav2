# Shared 25-row pager helper and Management Account Request queue

## Description

Delivers PageRequest, a non-generic IPagedResult implemented by PagedResult<T>, and one _Pager partial, at a fixed 25 rows with a unique-id tiebreak, filters and authorization applied before Count, page fallbacks, pager links that keep the current query string, navigation hidden for a single page, and an empty state. Applies it to the Management Account Request queue.

## Requirements

Verify: An authenticated officer navigates the Account Request queue and observes 25 items per page ordered by request timestamp then request id, the request time on the queue shows in Asia/Manila with its label, working previous and next controls that keep the active filter in the query string, hidden pagination on single pages, page 1 for an invalid page, the last page for an out-of-range page, and an empty state when no requests exist.

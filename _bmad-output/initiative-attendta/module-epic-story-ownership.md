# AttendTa module, epic, and story ownership

This is a mapping of the existing BMAD epics and stories to the module owners in the [WBS](../../docs/WBS_J4S_ATTENDTA_20261103.pdf), pages 9–11. Story IDs are written as `epic.story` (for example, `3.15`); the linked `tickets.toml` files contain the full descriptions, verification criteria, and dependencies. This document is an ownership reference, not a separate set of BMAD tickets or a record of completed work.

| WBS member | Owner | WBS modules | BMAD epics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Member 1 | Gabutan, Jerhon Clyde | AUTH-01–03 | Epic 1: Platform access (authentication and shared access checks) |
| Member 2 | Taguiam, Jasper | MD-01–05 | Epic 2: Master data; shared pager in Epic 1 |
| Member 3 | Sinco / Singco, John Paul | EVT-01–04, REG-01–05 | Epic 3: Events and registration |
| Member 4 | Talisic, Jhon Rosell | QR-01, ATT-01–03 | Epic 4: Check-in |
| Member 5 | Pinca | CERT-01–02, REP-01, ADM-01–02 | Epics 5–7: Administration, certificates, and participation reports; administrator setup in Epic 1 |

The WBS spells Member 3 **Sinco**; the [BMAD ownership addendum](prd-attendta/addendum.md) notes the alternate spelling **Singco**. The WBS and BMAD addendum both place administration with Member 5. Some older implementation notes describe a conflicting Member 1 allocation; coordinate shared authentication and audit interfaces with Gabutan.

## BMAD sequence and dependencies

The planned epic order is **1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8**. This is a planning order, not a rule that every epic must wait for the preceding one: the dependency graph notes, for example, that Epic 5 does not wait for Epic 4. The owner tables below group stories by module and are not a story execution order.

The existing [BMAD dependency graphs](dependency-graphs.md) contain the per-epic diagrams, cross-epic dependencies and critical path. They describe the ticket tree at commit `420f72c`; check each story's `after` field and the current BMAD ticket status before starting work. The graph's earliest-start waves are reproduced here for convenience. Stories in a wave can start in parallel only when their prerequisites and applicable epic gates are met; the waves do not indicate completion or assignment.

## Using BMAD with this map

The repository already has its epic and story breakdowns in `tickets.toml`; this Markdown file makes their ownership easier to read. The local command `.opencode/commands/bmad-create-epics-and-stories.md` describes a `bmad-create-epics-and-stories` workflow for generating a breakdown, but its referenced skill is not present in this checkout. The available `_bmad/method/scripts/tickets.py` supports `status`, `next`, `find`, `pull`, `mark`, `mirror`, and `move`; its `status` and `next` commands inspect the existing tree rather than automatically assigning every story by WBS module. This map does not set BMAD tracker assignees.

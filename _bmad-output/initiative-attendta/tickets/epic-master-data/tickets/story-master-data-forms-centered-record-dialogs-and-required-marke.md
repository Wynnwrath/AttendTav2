# Master Data forms: centered record dialogs and required markers

## Description

Finale acceptance check for existing GitHub #128: the Member, Event Type and Venue editors from 2.12–2.14 meet docs/DESIGN.md (centered dialogs, focus entering/contained/restored, separate status versus Cancel/Save actions, retained validation, Venue photo preview). Fix only findings; required markers, fieldsets and constrained forms already shipped in #132. Runs with the 8.12 whole-app Impeccable pass.

## Requirements

Verify: All three editors satisfy docs/DESIGN.md: centered dialogs, keyboard focus entering/contained/restored, separate status versus Cancel/Save actions, retained validation and Venue photo preview. Close #128 only after 2.12–2.14 are complete and this combined walkthrough passes.

## Notes

- Existing issue #128 is reused, not closed or weakened by the split.
- Moved to the finale by the 2026-11-06 demo rescope: it is an acceptance check, not demo work. Impeccable critique and polish apply here as part of 8.12.

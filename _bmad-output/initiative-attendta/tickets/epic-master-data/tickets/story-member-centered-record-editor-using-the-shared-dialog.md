# Member centered record editor using the shared dialog

## Description

Apply 2.12's reusable record dialog to Member edit using the current real Member service. Preserve read-only email, academic fields, membership type, student-number correction reason and errors; do not add standalone creation or implement membership-status mutations. Leave the access-action slot partial that 1.13 placed in each Members list row (5.11 fills it) untouched; change only the Edit trigger and the edit form.

## Requirements

Verify: An Officer edits a Member in a centered dialog, sees a required correction reason and inline server errors, cancels without saving and returns focus to the original row. Phone-width content and actions remain reachable.

## Notes

- Demo phase (2026-11-06 demo rescope): frontend only, real backend only; this ticket adds no demo data.
- Done check: `dotnet build`, `npm run css:build` when views or styles change, and one look at the changed screen with `DemoData__Enabled=true`. No new automated tests, no per-ticket Impeccable critique or polish and no separate code-review pass; the pull request keeps green existing CI and one peer approval. Critique, polish and the full Verify line run once in 8.15.

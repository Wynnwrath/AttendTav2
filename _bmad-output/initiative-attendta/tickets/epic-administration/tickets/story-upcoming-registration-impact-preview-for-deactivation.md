# Upcoming registration impact preview for deactivation

## Description

Adds the deactivation preview to the Account access screen: a GET endpoint and dialog that call IRegistrationCancellationService.PreviewUpcomingForUserAsync from epic-events-registration (AD-6) and list the upcoming, not-yet-started Registrations without Valid Attendance that the deactivation would cancel. The preview takes no lock and writes nothing; the Administration module adds no query of its own. Entry 6 reuses this endpoint for membership deactivation.

## Requirements

Verify: In ASI.Basecode.IntegrationTests, requesting the deactivation preview for a user registered for two upcoming un-attended events and one already-attended event (with attendance verified via a seeded attendance row) displays a modal listing only the two affected upcoming registrations.
